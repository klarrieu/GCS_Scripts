-Convert LiDAR to orthometric coordinate system, if necessary.
-Classify ground areas as polygon, if desired.

1. LiDAR_Processing

-validate output, then produce DEM.
-make upstream source polygon for centerline creation, with "Id"=1


2. create_centerline


3. create_station_lines

-clip xs lines where they intersect twice
-make one column: "dist_down" distance downstream
-choose slope breaks for DEM detrending


4. DEM_detrending

-make rating curve with WinXSPRO


5. Run Tuflow

6. extract_channel_dims

7. classify_landforms

8. GCS_analysis


extra tools: landform stratified velocities, reach aggregate metrics, hypsograph analysis, create thalweg


schema:

master GUI class:

for each tab/tool, use a class object that executes corresponding function?

parallelize long loops of function calls!!

use progressbar widgets?

errorbox decorator on all command functions!

user *args to make functions more robust
